# Autosplitters

Scripts in autosplitter language (asl) to be used in speedrunning timers.
All of these scripts were tested and intended for [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit), but they might (hopefully) work on other timers, if they support .asl scripts.

## Flash games

Some of these autosplitters are for Flash games. These splitters were tested running the respective game through [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://github.com/FlashpointProject/launcher).

So far, said Flash games are:
 - Zed
 - KND - Ice Creamed
